# 293-project

This repository contains the course project for STAT 293 (Regression Analysis) at the University of California, Riverside.  
The project is completed by **Yifan Wu** and **Kaiming Wang**.

In this project, we explore transfer learning methods for high-dimensional generalized linear models (GLMs), focusing on negative-transfer avoidance and source-detection strategies.

Specifically, we implement and evaluate the algorithms proposed in the **`glmtrans`** R package

## What We Do in This Project

We generate one target dataset and multiple source datasets.
We visualize and interpret the detection results.
We compare classical Lasso and transfer learning estimator (via `glmtrans`)
We construct confidence intervals for estimated parameters
